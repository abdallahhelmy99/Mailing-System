# Mailing System App

## Description
The mailing system app developed using Flutter is a mobile application that allows users to manage their emails and contacts locally on their phone's database. This app provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to send and receive emails, organize them into folders, and manage their contacts.

The app works by syncing with the user's email account and pulling all their emails into the local database on the phone. This enables users to access their emails even when they are offline. The app also allows users to compose and send emails, which are stored in the local database until they are ready to be sent.

In addition to email management, the app also provides a contact management feature, allowing users to add, edit, and delete their contacts directly from the app. The app syncs with the user's phone contact list and stores the contacts locally, allowing users to access them even when they are offline.

Overall, the mailing system app developed using Flutter is a reliable and convenient solution for managing emails and contacts on the go. Its local database feature ensures that users can access their emails and contacts even without an internet connection.
